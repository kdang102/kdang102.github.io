                <p> As a part of my User Interface Design class, I, along with a team of 4 other students, went through the process of creating a prototype an app with a focus on human-centered design.</p>

                <h2> Initial Design </h2>
                <p> These were the initial designs of the "quests" section of our prototype. </p>
                <div class="thirds-container">
                    <div class="">
                        <img src="images/screen1.png" alt="">
                        <p>The initial design overall had a good strcuture, but the colors were 
                            inconsistent and blended into the background.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="">
                        <img src="images/screen2.png" alt="">
                        <p> The color of the text made it difficult to read. This task card was 
                            a good start, but needed more options for repitition.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="">
                        <img src="images/screen3.png" alt="">
                        <p> The image was a bit boring, and the rewards were a bit confusing. It
                            is unclear what the points, exp, and prize are.
                        </p>

                <h2> Heuristic Evaluations, Feedback, and Iteration</h2>
                <p> After receiving peer evaluations based on usability heuristics, we made some changes to the design</p>

                <div class="thirds-container">
                    <div>
                        <img src="images/better_screen1.png" alt="">
                        <p> The original design needed more contrast in colors for the user to clearly
                            see what was selected at all times. We also added a tutorial button for new 
                            users.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <img src="images/better_screen2.png" alt="">
                        <p> This screen was changed for simular reasons. The was chosen to be a color with 
                            higher contrast to increase readibility. A repeat option was
                            also added for convenience.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <img src="images/better_screen3.png" alt="">
                        <p> We received feedback on the original page being a bit too vague. 
                            Users often did nothave a good sense of their progres, so we removed 
                            extra information and added a progrss bar.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="thirds-container">
                    <img src="images/tut1.png" alt="">
                    <img src="images/tut2.png" alt="">
                    <img src="images/tut3.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <p> As mentioned before, a tutorial was added into the design to teach new users 
                    how to use the app. Each page even highlights the feature it is referring to.
